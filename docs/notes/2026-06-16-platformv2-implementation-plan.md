# platformv2 — Implementation Plan

**Status:** confirmed (2026-06-16) · **Slice 1 landed** (render `615caa4`, publish
`c9ffc0c`) · **Slices D1–D2 (DSL core + I/O verbs) landed** in `core/dsl` (D2: interp
`fc835b8`, I/O verbs `f4edb4e`) · **D3a (`Ops.Vars` config passthrough) landed** ·
**D3b-1 (bootstrap write-path) + D3b-2 (assembly layer, `core/baseline`) landed**. D3b-3
split into **3a (CUE file-map render+publish rework) — landed**, **3b (extension router +
`.platform` route) — landed**. **D3b-4a/4b landed** (`platform init` + checkbox picker; baseline
directives cert-manager/flux/argocd-toggle/nginx-gateway; `[ops.vars]` → `map[string]any`). The
**DSL front-end was redesigned mid-D3b-4** (2026-06-20) — real lexer/parser, first-class paths,
strict `bare=var / quoted=string` values, and `focus`/`reset` scope (no `[field=value]`); see the
[DSL-scope ADR](../decisions/2026-06-20-dsl-focus-scope-strict-values.md) and the
[DSL spec](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md) (authoritative). · supersedes the ad-hoc ordering in
`PLANS.md`. **Reads against:** `docs/spec/platform.md`, `config-allocation.md`,
`gitops-build-plan.md`, and `docs/decisions/*`.

**Engine LIVE on stage9 (2026-06-24):** deployed `sts/dagger-engine` + headless
`svc/dagger-engine` into the `platform` ns (co-tenant with the vanity server, by design) —
**2/2 pods Ready**, headless resolves **2 A-records** (`10.2.0.220` dagger-engine-0 /
`10.2.0.221` dagger-engine-1, both ready), so **E3's DNS-discovery substrate is verified
live**. Applied through the ace-connect infra agent (it held the `kubectl apply`; chakrit
ok'd the cluster mutation); `namespace.yaml` skipped since the ns pre-exists. **Deferred:**
NetworkPolicy + resource req/limits → the widened harden pass (PLANS.md #4) — the engine
currently listens unauth on `:1234`, privileged + headless (any pod cluster-wide gets
root-on-node), accepted on staging only. **Follow-ups:** (1) `parts.#PodSpread` is soft
(`whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway`) → both pods landed on node `241c0a`, no node-HA;
consider `DoNotSchedule` in the engine pass. (2) Full round-robin *dispatch* test (a real
build spread `idx%n` across both engines) is still pending — it needs an **in-cluster build
driver**, which couples to **platform.cue self-deploy**. `platform.cue` is now fully
specifiable from the live vanity spec (Keel-managed, `./platform vanity`, image
`ghcr.io/prod9/platform:platform.prodigy9.co`, port 8000, `envFrom platform-secret`, labels
`app=platform`/`part-of=platform`).*

**Next (resume here, 2026-06-24):** *Last session landed E0 fx pin (`547e210`), smoke
`v0.2.4`→`v0.4.0` machinery upgrade (`aba8b45`), and the drift-detection note (`602e9ac`). This
session landed **#5 plog→fxlog** as a build/server log split: `5b42201` rename
`internal/plog`→`internal/buildlog`, `6fb74be` route `vanity` onto `fxlog`. Tree clean,
`go build`/`vet`/`test` + smoke (UNCHANGED) all green. **Nothing pushed** — several commits
ahead of `gh`, awaiting chakrit's say-so.* The engine spine is **fully render-verified** — engine ADR +
dispatcher (E3), the **flat-baseline simplification** (no markers/`Select`; one list + `Defaults` +
install-time selection — [ADR](../decisions/2026-06-22-flat-baseline-install-time-selection.md)),
**B3a** (render via the linked CUE engine, not the `cue` binary —
[ADR](../decisions/2026-06-23-render-via-linked-cue-engine.md)), **B3b** (`platform init` scaffolds
`cue.mod/module.cue` via `mod/modfile` — `fda24c0`), and **E1b** (engine render-verify — `35b25da`)
are all in. defs shipped `#headless` + `parts.#PodMounts #claim_templates` in `defs@v0.3.21`;
`dagger-engine.cue` now render-verifies to a clean StatefulSet + headless Service (clusterIP: None),
and `baseline.DefsVersion` pins v0.3.21. **Immediate next** (all need chakrit / a cluster — not
AFK-able): **take the engine live** (deploy the rendered manifests → exercise E3's live round-robin),
the cross-repo **`settings.toml` → `platform.toml` migration** (attended), and **Slice 2** (Flux
reconcile + cutover, needs a reachable cluster). **plog→fxlog (#5) landed 2026-06-24** as a
build-log / server-log split (not a wholesale swap — fxlog has no levels/writer by design; see
the [log-channel ADR](../decisions/2026-06-24-split-build-and-server-log-channels.md)). With #5
done, **no in-envelope unblocked slice remains** — every immediate next step needs a cluster or
attended cross-repo work. See the engine slice plan (E0–E3/B3) below for per-slice commits. `go build`
+ `go test ./...` + `go vet` + smoke (`./test.sh`) all green. **Test machinery upgraded
(2026-06-23):** smoke `v0.2.4` → `v0.4.0` (lock re-keyed by spec basename — re-committed once; new
frozen exit-code contract, harmless under test.sh's `errexit`; dup test names now hard-fail load) and
the `infra-basic` Render test fixed — its stale pre-D3b-3 streamed-manifest snapshot now checks
`exitcode` + the printed path + a **file-content glob** (`./testbeds/infra-basic/k8s/infra-basic/*.yaml`)
that captures the rendered manifest itself (stronger than the old stdout snapshot). smoke file-glob
checks snapshot content, not just existence (coordinated w/ the smoke agent). Not pushed.

**fx replace caveat — resolved (2026-06-23):** fx cut `v0.8.6` (tag `4fd53f3`, the
`MultiSelect(q, defaults, options)` + `OptionalMultiSelect` rewrite); platform pinned
`fx.prodigy9.co@v0.8.6` and dropped `replace => ../fx`. The tag commits the exact `../fx` tree
platform already built against (annotated tag `4fd53f3` → HEAD `fee33fb`), so the pin is
behavior-identical. Fresh clones are go-gettable again. **E0 fully closed.**

**Engine slice plan (2026-06-21):** ran **E1 → E0 → E3 → E2**, then **B3a/B3b** and **E1b** —
all landed; the engine spine is fully render-verified.
- **E1 — engine manifest** · *authored `afece7d`; render-verified `35b25da` (E1b) against
  `defs@v0.3.21` — `#headless` + `parts.#PodMounts #claim_templates` shipped; the engine app moved
  off its hand-inlined volumeClaimTemplates onto `#PodMounts` (storage class now set).*
  `apps/dagger-engine.cue`
  (in `core/baseline/files/apps/`, inert until E2 wires the embed) on `defs.#StatefulSet`: `replicas: 2`,
  privileged, `--addr tcp://…:1234`, inline `volumeClaimTemplates`→`/var/lib/dagger`, `parts.#PodSpread`,
  `platform` namespace, headless `#Service`. The one blocker — `#Service` `#headless` (closed spec) — is
  handed to the **infra-defs agent** as a wishlist (`docs/notes/2026-06-21-defs-wishlist-dagger-engine.md`);
  it ships + pings, then platform pins the new `defs@vX` and finishes render-verify in `../infra`.
- **E0 — fx bump** · *landed `4734846`.* `replace fx.prodigy9.co => ../fx` (`ea91e67`: prompts on x/term +
  `MultiSelect`); zero code changes — the 5 touchpoints stayed API-compatible; build + tests green. **Replace dropped + pinned
  `fx.prodigy9.co@v0.8.6` (2026-06-23) — E0 fully closed.** **plog→fxlog (#5) NOT done** — now
  unblocked, left as its own slice.
- **E3 — dispatcher** · *landed `58a60db`.* `builder/engine.go` (DNS discovery of headless A-records,
  gated on `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`; pure + unit-tested) + `builder/session.go` engine-client pool +
  per-job `idx%n` via `forEngine`; `BuildResult.engine` so Publish mints the registry secret on the same
  engine. Off-cluster → single auto-provisioned engine (cold-start path). Live round-robin verified at the
  dogfood deploy.
- **E2 — appliance wiring** · *landed + simplified.* Net of E2a/E2c then a model
  simplification (`dad0048`, [flat-baseline ADR](../decisions/2026-06-22-flat-baseline-install-time-selection.md)):
  the marker grammar + render-time `Select` are **gone**. `core/baseline` = one flat
  `EmbeddedFiles` list (clean names, `.platform` + `.cue`) + hard-coded `Defaults`; init's
  `OptionalMultiSelect` (new fx 3-arg sig, `../fx@4d66e8b`) installs the chosen subset into the
  target's `apps/` (co-located, render routes by extension). `[ops.vars]` = version pins only.
  NGF is now two clean files (`nginx-gateway-experimental` default + `nginx-gateway` stable).
  - **cue.mod scaffold** — done in B3b (`fda24c0`, via `mod/modfile`).
  - Full engine **render-verify** — done in E1b (`35b25da`, against `defs@v0.3.21`).

- **B3 — render via the linked CUE engine, not the `cue` binary.**
  - **B3a** *(done `b238593`)* — `cuelang.org/go@v0.15.4` pinned; `exportCue` rewritten on the Go
    API (`cue/load` + `cuecontext` + `mod/modconfig` registry + `encoding/yaml`; image →
    `Config.Tags`). No more `exec.Command("cue")` — kills the ambient-binary / v0.16.1-`parts`-panic
    landmine; engine version pinned in go.mod to match defs. (Render-by-extension naming also fixed:
    `renderCue`/`renderDirectives`, `b238593`/`70014c6`.)
  - **B3b** *(done `fda24c0`)* — `platform init` scaffolds `cue.mod/module.cue` via `mod/modfile`
    (not a `cue mod init` shell): module path prompted greenfield-only, `language.version` from
    `cue.LanguageVersion()` (tracks the linked engine, can't drift newer than it), defs dep pinned
    from new `baseline.DefsModule`/`DefsVersion` consts. `HasCueModule` gates both the prompt and
    the plan entry — an existing cue.mod is the operator's truth, never rewritten.

**Dogfood (2026-06-21):** platform self-hosts — it is one of the rendered `apps/*` and is
built/published/delivered by its own pipeline + engine pool. Cold-start has no unbreakable cycle
(engine ships as plain manifests; first platform image built by a local auto-provisioned engine).

## Framing

Spine-first, incremental monorepo — the spec anchor (`platform.md` § Anchors). A big-bang
`api/ cli/ ui/ core/` restructure as step one is the wrong move: it churns the test
harness (`test.sh`/`tests.cue`/testbeds), Dockerfile, and bootstrapper for zero functional
gain. Build along the spine (build → render → publish → reconcile); migrate the monorepo
as new code lands.

**Aggression (2026-06-16):** chakrit has no mission-critical workloads deployed, so we may
chunk slices and replace the live delivery path (Keel → Flux) freely. Calibrated into the
slice sizes below.

**Wholesale-replace, never migrate (2026-06-25):** This is a from-scratch rework. *Every*
pre-rework artifact — the live Keel-managed vanity Deployment, `infra/apps/platform.cue`
(`#UseKeel`, moving-tag image), Keel itself, the old `settings.toml`, any `platform`-named
legacy — is **disposable**: overwritten wholesale by the new setup, never preserved, matched,
or migrated. There is nothing to migrate and no production that can't be taken down. Author
every new artifact straight from the current plan; do **not** reverse-engineer from, diff
against, or protect legacy.

**ArgoCD + Keel: fully deprecated, fleet-wide (2026-06-25).** Not platform-only. The new setup
(Flux GitOps + committed-literal images) is the *sole* delivery path for *every* app on stage9.
All Keel consumers (`lem`/`infra`/`x9`/`fx`) and all ArgoCD-managed apps
(`tmg`/`stage9`/`sunzapper`/`bluepages`/`ircp`) migrate onto it; Keel and ArgoCD are removed
entirely. Nothing is preserved for them on the **prod9 clusters** (internal `prodigy9` +
`stage9`) — no mission-critical workloads there, nothing that can't be taken down. (Other
setups — `naxon-infra`, `fi-infra` — DO carry mission-critical workloads; they migrate to the
new platform eventually too, but carefully, *not* in this take-down-freely bucket.)

**Posture toward pre-rework agents (2026-06-25).** Agents whose domain is the *old* infra (the
infra agent's ArgoCD/Keel/legacy-app world) are **outdated and wrong by default** — that world
is being torn down. They stay useful as cluster *executors*, but their design judgments and
objections rooted in preserving legacy do **not** constrain the new platform design: override
them, drive from the plan. Do not defer to legacy-grounded caution.

## Decisions — status

- **Spine-first** (Phase A delivery before Phase B server/RBAC) — *taken* (2026-06-16).
  The server *orchestrates* the spine, so build the orchestrated thing first; the spine
  has no identity deps (buildable now); the server is the biggest/riskiest piece. RBAC is
  the rewrite's *justification* but not its first build.
- **New code born in `core/` **, flat packages migrate later (opportunistic, not an
  up-front B1 restructure) — *taken* (2026-06-16). Slice 1 doesn't import `builder/`
  /`project/`/etc., so an up-front move is pure churn that blocks first delivery behind a
  harness rewrite, on an unvalidated layout. New code goes straight to its final home; old
  flat packages move once in B1, after the spine has proved the layout.
- **Renderer = `cue export`, not timoni** — *taken* (2026-06-16). See the
  [renderer ADR](../decisions/2026-06-16-renderer-cue-export-not-timoni.md). `cue` is on
  the host; infra-defs is the packaging layer; foreign manifests are patched by the
  [manifest patch DSL](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md). No timoni, no vendored k8s schemas,
  no Dagger forced for render.
- **Slice 1 = render + publish, merged** — *taken* (2026-06-16). Aggression: produce the
  consumable OCI config artifact end-to-end, not render-only.
- **Package name `core/gitops` ** — *taken* (2026-06-16, adjustable). Names the delivery
  mechanism (pull-based GitOps via `cue export` + Flux + OCI), matching the spec framing.
- **CLI namespace `ops` ** — *taken* (2026-06-17). The delivery spine is grouped under
  `platform ops` (`ops render`, `ops publish`); `render` moved there from top-level.
  Avoids colliding with the existing container-release `publish`. Full rationale and
  parked follow-ups in [slice-1 open questions](2026-06-17-slice1-open-questions.md).

## Phases

### Phase A — delivery spine (no server)

Order: Slice 1 (done) → the patch-DSL slices D1–D3 (Phase A′) → Slice 2. D1–D3 come
before Slice 2 because Slice 2 installs the baseline, and the baseline is the DSL's first
consumer.

- **Slice 1 — render + publish.** ✅ **Landed 2026-06-17.** `cue export` an infra CUE
  module → multi-doc manifests → push as the OCI config artifact under a **moving**
  per-env tag. Pure code; locally testable; no cluster. Detailed below. **Revised in D3b-3:**
  the flat `-e objects` single-stream render becomes a filename→docs **file-map** emitter
  (`k8s/<component>/*.yaml`), matching the real infra layout, and `ops render` routes `.cue`
  vs `.platform` by extension (see the
  [render-routing ADR](../decisions/2026-06-18-render-routes-cue-and-platform-by-extension.md)).
- **Slice 2 — reconcile + cutover.** Install Flux (source + kustomize controllers, OCI),
  `OCIRepository` on the moving tag, `prune: true`; inventory Keel/argocd workloads;
  migrate workload-by-workload; retire Keel (they fight over the image field otherwise).
  **Depends on:** D1–D3 (the baseline install). **Env prereq:** a reachable cluster +
  working `flux`/`kubectl` (host `kubectl` is broken — run from a cluster-admin context).
  Mostly manifests + ops; seeded via the embedded baseline.

### Phase A′ — patch DSL + embedded init (the appliance baseline)

Pulled forward from Phase C (2026-06-17). The [manifest patch DSL](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md)
is the primitive for adapting foreign installs; the embedded baseline (the
[appliance ADR](../decisions/2026-06-17-opinionated-appliance-embedded-init.md)) is its
first consumer; bootstrap writes it into the infra repo. Port source:
`infra-cli/pipelines/*` + `pipelines/yamleditor`. Dogfood target: the real `infra` repo.

- **Slice D1 — DSL core (hermetic).** ✅ **Landed.** Path-walk (`Get`/`Set`/`Remove`/
  `Append` over `map[string]any`/`[]any`, incl. the `[name=v]` field-select form), the
  in-buffer verbs (`select`, `reset`, `set`, `set-if-absent`, `append`, `append-if-absent`,
  `remove`, `remove-doc`), the lexer, and the directive parser. No network. Built from
  scratch (the `yamleditor` API didn't fit the spec'd shape — see below), unit-tested on
  inline multi-doc fixtures. Lives in `core/dsl`.
- **Slice D2 — I/O verbs.** ✅ **Landed.** `download URL` (behind `Options.Fetch`,
  default HTTP GET; fixtured in tests), `extract` (polymorphic: magic-byte zip/tar/gz, two
  layers), `\(var)` interpolation (string-only, CUE syntax), and `emit "FILENAME"` → write
  the buffer to a named file under `Options.OutDir` (truncate/replace, no `..` escape). The
  DSL is a yaml editor: it writes files and is done — delivery is a separate pipeline.
  `\(var)` values come from `platform.toml`'s generic `[ops.vars]` (`project.Ops.Vars
  map[string]string` — see the
  [generic-ops-vars ADR](../decisions/2026-06-17-generic-ops-vars-single-config.md)); no
  typed DTO, wired in D3. **Decisions:** checksum guard **deferred** (chakrit, 2026-06-18 —
  revisit alongside a body/size cap on the network+decompression trust boundary); the
  `\\(`-escape vs `\\`-unescape ordering **resolved** by deferring all escape + interp
  resolution out of the lexer into a single left-to-right `resolve` pass, so `\\(` is
  consumed before its `(` can start an interpolation.
- **Slice D3a — `Ops.Vars` config passthrough. ✅ Landed.** Added `Ops.Vars
  map[string]string` (`[ops.vars]`, generic, no per-software fields), stored verbatim by
  the processor — no defaults, no inference. The DSL already consumes it via `Options.Vars`;
  the assembly layer (gating) landed in D3b-2 as whole-file selection in `core/baseline`, not
  here.
- **Slice D3b — baseline authoring + embed + bootstrap-writes-DSL.** Split into D3b-1..4
  (hermetic mechanics first, content last). **D3b-1 (bootstrap write-path) landed:**
  `bootstrapper.Analyze`/`Plan`/`Apply` with hard wd-validation (must be a git repo),
  surgical `[ops.vars]` merge on re-bootstrap, and a print-plan-then-confirm flow
  (`--force` skips). **D3b-2 (assembly layer, `core/baseline`) landed:** gating is
  whole-file selection by filename convention (`name@variant.platform` choice / `name+flag.platform`
  toggle / plain), keyed off `[ops.vars]` — the DSL stays branch-free (chakrit, option C).
  **D3b-3** `ops render` routes by extension — `.cue` → file-map `cue export`, `.platform` →
  `baseline.Select` → `dsl.Apply` — both writing `k8s/<component>/*.yaml` into a render-output
  tree (model I, nothing committed; reworks Slice-1 render from the `-e objects` stream) +
  bootstrap option prompts. **Landed in three:** **3a** reworked `core/gitops` to the file-map
  contract — `Render(srcDir,image)` exports the `apps` package (`<srcDir>/apps`, top-level field =
  app/component, its keys = filenames → doc-or-list) into a `Tree` (`<component>/<filename>` →
  multi-doc bytes); `Tree.WriteDir` + `Publish(tree)` (tarball walks the tree, drops the single
  `manifests.yaml`); `ops render` gains `--out` (default `k8s`); testbed `infra-basic` migrated to
  the `apps/` package, render output gitignored. **3b** added the `.platform` route:
  `Render(srcDir, RenderOptions{Image, Vars, Fetch})` fuses both routes into one `Tree` —
  the apps CUE export plus the `baseline/` directive set (`baseline.Select` over `[ops.vars]` →
  `dsl.Apply` into a per-component temp dir, read back as `<component>/<emitted>`). `baseline.Component`
  owns the directive→`k8s/<component>` mapping (stem before `@`/`+`); either route skips when its
  package dir is absent; `ops render`/`publish` pass `cfg.Ops.Vars`. The `Fetch` seam keeps the
  route hermetically testable. **Prompts** fold into D3b-4 (no baseline option files exist until
  then). See the
  [render-routing ADR](../decisions/2026-06-18-render-routes-cue-and-platform-by-extension.md);
  supersedes the interim model-II "separate run-DSL command" framing. **D3b-4** baseline
  `.platform` content + `settings.toml` fold-in. **D3b-4a landed:** `core/baseline` `go:embed`s
  the directive set + ships `DefaultVars`, exposed via `EmbeddedFiles`/`DefaultVars`; seeded with
  `cert-manager.platform` (download upstream by `\(cert_manager_version)`, emit; cluster-issuer
  stays CUE), dogfooded against live upstream. Decisions confirmed in the
  [D3b-4 design-prep note](2026-06-19-d3b4-baseline-design-prep.md) (nginx-gateway
  experimental-only, engine is CUE not DSL, versions via `[ops.vars]`). **D3b-4b landed:**
  `platform init` (git-inits, writes platform.toml[ops.vars] + embedded `baseline/*.platform`,
  runs a generic `ScanOptions` checkbox picker; not the app build script/pipeline). Directives:
  **cert-manager** + **flux** (v2.8.8) always-on; **argocd** off-by-default toggle;
  **nginx-gateway** (NGF experimental) on-by-default toggle — downloads experimental gateway-api
  CRDs + NGF CRDs + controller and patches the `NginxProxy` (serverTokens=off + Linode firewall
  annotation as a StrategicMerge service patch). All dogfooded against live upstream; NGF output
  matches the infra repo's committed `k8s/nginx-gateway/nginx-gateway.yaml`. DSL enablers:
  `[ops.vars]` widened to `map[string]any` (typed); `set` stopped coercing (bare `\(x)` keeps the
  var type, `"\(x)"` forces string); path nav gained jq-style quoted keys + auto-vivifying `set`.
  **Deferred:** the Dagger **engine** (CUE DaemonSet, ours — Phase B-ish) and the cross-repo
  `settings.toml` → `platform.toml` migration (attended-only).
  Detail in the [design-prep note](2026-06-19-d3b4-baseline-design-prep.md).

  **D3b-4 detail** — authoritative gating/render detail lives in the
  [spec](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md) and the
  [render ADR](../decisions/2026-06-18-render-routes-cue-and-platform-by-extension.md):
  author the baseline (Flux seed + cert-manager + NGF + engine) as `.platform` directive
  files + a default `[ops.vars]`, `go:embed` them, bootstrap writes them into the infra repo.
  Authored bits (namespaces, RBAC, Gateway, platform Deployment) stay CUE; foreign installs
  are `.platform`. **Choice-default note:** `baseline.Select`'s default for an unset choice is
  the lexically-first variant (e.g. `nginx-gateway` → `experimental`); add an explicit default
  marker if that turns out to be the wrong safe default. **Migration:** fold the infra repo's
  `settings.toml` into `platform.toml` (versions/flags → `[ops.vars]`; `maintainers`/`repo.url`
  → existing `maintainer`/`repository`) and delete it — cross-repo, attended only. Dogfood:
  reproduce `infra`'s `k8s/{cert-manager,nginx-gateway}` via directives.

### Phase B — control plane (the RBAC justification)

Prereq: **fx v0.4.0 → v0.8.2 bump** (PLANS.md #3) before any server code — pulls in fxlog
and the cmd-API drift. Chunk aggressively:

- **B1 — monorepo firm-up.** Move existing packages into `core/` (`builder`, `project`,
  `releases`, `gitctx`, types), split out `cli/`; one Go module across `api/cli/core`. Fix
  `test.sh` /`tests.cue`/testbeds/Dockerfile. Lower-risk now — spine code already proved
  the layout.
- **B2 — server skeleton + identity.** `api/` on fx + Postgres: health, migrations,
  `users` /`identities` schema, GitHub device-flow OAuth → platform token,
  `platform login`.
- **B3 — Projects + RBAC.** Project entity, members/roles, repo binding (`platform.toml`),
  audit. API + CLI.
- **B4 — gated deploy.** Authed user → write the immutable image ref into `infra/` CUE
  author-as-user (GitHub App) → triggers Slice 1's render+publish. Couples build+config so
  an unbuilt image can't be referenced.
- **B5 — brokers.** Kube token (`TokenRequest`, pod SA, exec-credential `kubeconfig`);
  secret-pull init-container.
- **B6 — UI.** SvelteKit (plain JS), adapter-static, `go:embed` into `api`. v1: Login,
  Projects, Access, Deploys, Target status (Flux CR status).

### Phase C — fold-ins (detail in `PLANS.md`)

The patch DSL + init baseline moved to **Phase A′** (2026-06-17). Remaining: **#7**
version/provenance injection into runner images · **#4** container hardening (non-root
etc.) · **#5** plog → fxlog (rides B's fx bump) · residual infra-cli generators not
covered by the DSL port.

## Slice 1 — render + publish (landed 2026-06-17)

**Goal:** render an infra CUE module to manifests via `cue export`, then publish them as
the OCI config artifact. Landed as two commits — render → stdout (`615caa4`), then publish
(`c9ffc0c`).

**Code (born in `core/`), as landed:**

- `core/gitops/render.go` — runs `cue export -e objects --out yaml` over the module (cue
  is on the host), then walks the YAML sequence and emits each object as one multi-doc
  (`---`) document. Image injected via `--inject image=` into the module's `@tag(image)`.
  No Dagger.
- `core/gitops/publish.go` — packages the manifest stream as a single gzipped-tar layer
  and packs it with **Flux media types** (`…flux.config.v1+json`,
  `…flux.content.v1.tar+gzip`) via **oras-go**, pushed to any `oras.Target` under the
  moving per-env tag.
- `core/gitops/registry.go` — resolves `oci://host/repo:tag` and authenticates from
  `REGISTRY_USERNAME`/`REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (registry host comes from the ref; defined
  locally, not imported from `builder/`, to keep the spine decoupled).
- `cmd/ops.go` (parent), `cmd/ops_render.go`, `cmd/ops_publish.go` — cobra wiring under
  the `platform ops` namespace; stays in `cmd/`, no premature `cli/` split. The publish
  target is **convention-over-configuration** (2026-06-17): no `--to` flag — it comes from
  the `[ops]` section of `platform.toml`, where `image` is inferred from `repository`
  (`ghcr.io/x`) and `tag` defaults to `latest` (`project.Ops.Ref`). `--tag` overrides the
  moving tag for a per-env publish.

**Fixture:** `testbeds/infra-basic/` — a thin CUE module depending on `prodigy9.co/defs`
(infra-defs), declaring one app (Deployment + Service via a pack or wrappers) with a
parameterized image tag, exposing an `objects` list. The real work/risk is the
`cue export → multi-doc emit` shape and the infra-defs `CUE_REGISTRY` wiring, **not**
vendoring schemas — there are none to vendor.

**Test plan (TDD), as landed:**

- **Render:** smoke case in `tests.cue` —
  `./testbed.sh infra-basic ops render --image x:y` → exit 0, stdout snapshot contains the
  Deployment with `image: x:y`.
- **Publish:** Go unit test (`core/gitops/publish_test.go`) round-trips the manifests
  through a filesystem `oci.Store` — pushes, pulls every layer back, and asserts byte
  identity plus Flux media types. **No publish smoke:** a live-registry round-trip needs
  creds + network, which the 1m honest-timeout harness forbids; live push is validated
  manually / in Slice 2.
- **Broad:** `./test.sh` full suite stays green; `go test ./...` covers the unit side.
- **Caveat:** the fixture resolves `prodigy9.co/defs` from `ghcr.io/prod9` on first run —
  if the module fetch brushes the 1m `tests.cue` timeout, warm the CUE module cache and
  re-run; do **not** raise the timeout.

The manifest patch DSL ([spec](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md)) is **not** in this slice —
it adapts third-party installs and lands next, in **Phase A′** (Slices D1–D3). Slice 1 is
author-our-own-manifests only.

## Slice D1 — DSL core (landed)

**Goal:** a hermetic, in-memory manifest patch engine — parse a directive file, apply the
buffer-editing verbs to a multi-doc YAML stream, no network. This is the bulk of the DSL
and the part that is cleanly unit-testable.

**Built from scratch, not ported.** `infra-cli/pipelines/yamleditor` was read for verb
*semantics*, but its generic variadic-`any` `Get`/`Set` API didn't fit the spec'd shape
(field-select `[name=v]`, cumulative `select` scope, the directive model), so the path-walk
is native. Reference only: `infra-cli/pipelines/{yamleditor,edit_yaml}.go`.

**Code (`core/dsl`), as landed:**

- `path.go` — parse the dotted path syntax into a closed `Step` sum type
  (`Key`/`Index`/`Select`); `[name=v]` is the load-bearing field-select form.
- `walk.go` — `Get`/`Set`/`Remove`/`Append` over `map[string]any`/`[]any`; `Set` creates
  intermediate maps; field-select resolves to a live index at walk time; list-element
  `Remove` shortens and writes back.
- `lex.go` — line tokenizer: shell-style splitting, optional double-quotes (`\"`/`\\`),
  full-line + inline `#` comments. `\(…)` left verbatim (interpolation is D2).
- `parse.go` — the engine (buffer + scope-by-indices) and verb dispatch: `select`, `reset`,
  `set`, `set-if-absent`, `append`, `append-if-absent`, `remove`, `remove-doc`. Values are
  coerced to typed YAML scalars (`set .spec.replicas 3` writes int 3). I/O verbs are unknown
  until D2.

**Test plan (TDD, hermetic) — as landed:**

- Red→Green per layer (`path` → `walk` → `lex` → `parse`) against inline multi-doc
  fixtures: `[name=v]` selection, `append-if-absent`/`set-if-absent` idempotency, `reset` +
  cumulative `select`, `remove-doc` dropping scoped docs. Pure Go — `go test ./core/dsl/`.
- No smoke case (no CLI surface yet; the DSL gets wired to a command in D2/D3).

**Acceptance (met):** the cert-manager example from the
[DSL spec](../spec/manifest-patch-dsl.md) (minus `download`/`emit`, which are D2) applies
end-to-end in memory, asserting the controller container's `args` gained both flags and that
a second apply is a no-op.

## Open questions

- ~~`core/` migration: opportunistic vs explicit B1 restructure~~ — resolved:
  opportunistic.
- ~~Package naming: `core/gitops` vs `core/delivery` ~~ — resolved: `core/gitops`.
- ~~Renderer: timoni vs `cue export` ~~ — resolved: `cue export` (see renderer ADR).
- ~~`cue export` multi-doc emit shape~~ — resolved: top-level `objects` list, exported
  with `-e objects --out yaml` and split per element (`testbeds/infra-basic/infra.cue`,
  `core/gitops/render.go`).
- Two root trackers (`PLANS.md` + `TODOs.md`) — consolidate.
