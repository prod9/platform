* Support first release
* Get tags from github when release
  (because releaser might not have the latest tag)
* Upstream might be tracked during release
* Command to add environment without having to edit TOML

* sync dockerfiel builder from macbook
* and replaceattr impl in slog to strip out the timestamp
